# My walkthrough notes

Before writing any documentation, I walked through the process myself. I placed myself in the mindset of a user and took notes as I went. Read them below! Notes include what I was feeling and thinking (as a user) as well as reminders to myself for later (as a writer).

## Tutorial: Creating your profile README

### Setup

- I had an old repo in my profile. Deleted to see what a brand new user’s home page looks like. Thought I would need 3 possible starting points for accuracy and repeatability but then found a single simple solution:
  - [x] Use “+” in header nav because you can do it from any page  
- Account creation process is just like other standard websites. 
  - [x] Start tutorial at “create repo”
  - [x] **Prerequisite:** create account
  
### Create repo
  
- "You found a secret" pop-up **made me feel excited and successful** even though I haven't even pressed "go" on anything.
  - [x] Point it out in doc as celebratory moment. Sets a tone for GitHub's personality (despite the "scary" tech stuff for newbs).
  - [x] **INTRO the tutorial with the "secret" language to set that tone. Let user know they'll achieve something, and it's "special."** Even though they aren't programmers, they are welcome/worth it.
- Confused if I need a description, and what it would achieve/where it would appear.
  - [x] Put in a placeholder to see what happens- decide once I see result  
- Gut wants me to make it private by default (bc I don't know what I'm doing, and also privacy is important.)
  - [x] Note requirement for "public", for clarity/emphasis even though it also tells you in the pop-up 
- Don't know what any of the terms are for initializing options, descriptions are helpful but don't feel relevant to this task
  - "long description for project" doesn't feel helpful in this use case because there was a description form field above.
  - [x] Note README, tell them not to worry about the others. Say that the README file is where they'll write the info about themselves.
- Don't know what repo is, word shows up everywhere
  - [x] At **INTRO, do bare minimum explanation of repo** as storage place for files. Programmers use it to store code. We are going to use it to store a text file that will show up on your profile. Your "about me."

### Feedback on subtask success

- After creating, the repo page is *sort of* positive feedback... I know I did something but I can't really understand all the elements of the unfamiliar UI that I'm looking at.
  - Option to click "edit README" is helpful and clear, but **I want user to have positive feedback** that they successfully put a thing on their profile. Need to have **clarity that task is complete before switching** tasks in their mind to "now I can have fun deciding what to write."
  - [x] Note that they're looking at the home of their repo that contains all the information about it. Repos can contain multiple files and folders, and you could access them all here. But for this tutorial for your profile, you are only using one README file.
- [x] Next step - go to your profile via nav bar = success

### Edit README

- [x] Now change the placeholder text "hi there"
- There's suddenly more text in this box than "hi there"
  - [x] Note the 2 tabs, edit and preview
- Adding their text could happen before or after deleting the commented-out placeholder text (and the "hi there").
  - [x] **Pick a prescriptive path for user.** First instinct is: 
    1. Change header text
    1. Press enter and write your body text on the line right below the header. Use the ideas to get you started (like it says in the placeholder).
    1. Make bold and italic. List? **Basically, pick some markdown skills for them to learn** (Link to markdown reference - all sorts of interesting options, images, formats that they can explore.)
    1. Delete all the placeholder text within the angle brackets (including the brackets)
    1. Preview changes in the tab
- Wonder what I should write in place of "Update README.md" 
  - [x] Describe purpose (to easily keep track of the changes you made in your file). So name can be simple but indicative of what you did.
  - [x] INTRO include version control bare minimum explanation in addition to repo as storage place. 

### Feedback on task success

- Feel success seeing the repo update. But want to see it on my profile. 
  - Just noticed I can click on username in top-left file path. But it's confusing because the name of the repo is the same as the username, 
  - [x] ...so I'm going to **send users down the more intuitive/web standard path of going to the navbar/profile icon.** Otherwise would require explanation of file path UI. Unnecessary at this point even tho technically best practice.  
- SUCCESS!

### Conclusion

- [x] Add a **list of what they learned at the end,** to restate some key terms/concepts. (INTRO will be "this is the task you are going to do.")
- [x] Decide what to link to next? Explanation (uses for non-coders)... or would that come before, so that they have a reason/motivation to actually make an account? Other link option is the how-to. Or to a GitHub "be social" guide.
