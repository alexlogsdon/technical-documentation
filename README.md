## Creating your profile README

‚úè&nbsp; [Go to the doc](/creating-your-profile-readme.md)

üß† &nbsp; [Read my user walkthrough notes](/my-walkthrough-notes.md/#tutorial-creating-your-profile-readme)

**Document type:** Tutorial

**Goal:** Make users feel confident and accomplished so that they want to continue learning GitHub.

**Task:** Creating a profile README

   * It introduces users to basic GitHub concepts while completing a concrete task. 
   * The result is not a throw-away exercise. A profile README can be kept and shown off by the user, making them feel welcome in the GitHub community.

**Reader:** Brand new users & potential users
     
   * Technical writers who don't use GitHub
   * Prospective programmers exploring the community
   * Open source enthusiasts
   
**Reader questions:**

   * Do I have to know how to program? 
   * What would I put on GitHub if I'm not a programmer?
   * How do I navigate this website?
   * What is a repository? What is a README?
   
**Reader mindset:**

   * Curious... about what they can do with GitHub. 
   * Stuck... because tutorials they found online seemed aimed at programmers.
   * Optimistic... now that they have a guide meant for them.

**Document tone:**
  
   * Conversational... like a real human guide who's holding their hand.
   * Enthusiastic... by celebrating their successes along the way.
   * Empathetic... by showing compassion in moments of potential confusion or stress. Though the task is simple, the user may become overwhelmed by the expanse of the GitHub UI that they don't understand.

## Is my thermostat working

‚úè&nbsp; [Go to the doc](/is-my-thermostat-working.md)

**Document type:** Troubleshooting guide

**Reader's problem:** ‚ÄúThe room feels more hot/cold than I think it should. Does that mean the thermostat isn‚Äôt working? Or worse, my heating and cooling unit is malfunctioning?‚Äù

**Goal:** Help readers quickly investigate an open-ended problem. By the end, they'll know if they can solve it themselves or if they need to contact an expert for repairs. 

**Task:** Check thermostat controls to see if any of them are causing the problem.

**Reader:** Renters or homeowners

   * May or may not know how their thermostat and heating/cooling system actually works.
   * May or may not feel confident doing home repairs.
   * May or may not have set up and programmed the thermostat. 

**Reader‚Äôs mindset:**
  * Want to solve the problem fast. But they also feel confused about what‚Äôs
causing the problem, if there even is one.
  * Feeling a little anxious because if something is broken, it could be a problem
in extreme weather.
  * Are unsure if it‚Äôs a small problem they can solve on their own, or if they‚Äôll
need professional help.
